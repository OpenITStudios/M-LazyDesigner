# LazyDesigner Next Action

This file owns continuation only. Proof interpretation: [current-validation.md](current-validation.md); local/native acceptance: [local-acceptance-runbook.md](local-acceptance-runbook.md). Git owns completed work history. Test ownership: [test-architecture.md](../04-system/test-architecture.md).

## Primary next — Advanced Geometry CODE-FIRST (2026-11-01)

**USER DECISION:** Complete AI-first plugin code before tests.
Do not run/write tests, Bun/CI, native QA or release. Preserve one
LazyDesigner plugin, existing Gateway tools, Recipe engine and Undo.

**R3a–R3d:** Geometry composition (Curve, Cuboid, Frame, Repeat),
strict AI schema and internal `constructGeometry` plan/apply with
Project/Group/scene revision binding. Public `construct_geometry`
is not registered yet.

**R3e:** Project Recipe metadata source is preflighted and synchronized
through the original native Undo/Redo history entry, with exact-source
fail-closed checks and no second store.

**R3f:** Advanced native first create now uses the existing
`applyAuthoringRecipeIncrementalAtomic` rather than an untracked Cube
create. Stable Recipe ID is derived from Project/Group/feature IDs;
new Cubes are Recipe-owned and attached to the exact parent Group.
An existing Recipe must use revision planning, not a repeated create.

**PROOF:** Source-only code, not tested or built. CI disabled; no
installed Blockbench, save/reopen, Bedrock export or visual proof.

**NEXT CODE:** Finish AI-facing `construct_geometry` registration with
canonical generator-produced API docs in one complete delivery.
Then expand safe stored-Recipe revision and multi-feature correction.
No hand edits to generated docs. QA remains deferred.
## GitHub boundary and historical local recovery

- `Local` is the current remote working authority. Re-pin its HEAD before edits; this ChatGPT/GitHub context does not establish a local checkout, Bun or live Blockbench.
- Historical 2026-10-27 machine-local handoff: a primary checkout was dirty at `44b03b52`; 52 recovery payloads and 438 missing Crimson Sentinel paths were recorded. This is **not** proof of the user's present PC state. Do not touch or discard those historical assets.
- CI DISABLED: verification definitions remain inert. Do not enable workflows, change `main`/settings or publish releases.

## Current source / installed proof boundary

Gateway Stage receipt consistency and historical Golden/affected-test guards are source-authored, but NOT active Knowledge research work; Bun/native proof remains NOT EXECUTED. Prior installed `7b45bd69` / Desktop 0.1.1 evidence is historical. See [current-validation.md](current-validation.md). Protect user assets; no deployment, CI or release.

## Deferred Gateway integration context

**P0 integration:** Gateway verifies Stage/surface/target receipts. Rejected successful affinity mutations now require state inspection, not replay. Normal Control Delta uses the backend-verified project UUID for task-cohort continuity. Stage-before now comes from the same queued native preflight, without a separate status probe. Binding, catalog, same-Stage no-op and generation guards remain. Native proof/cost pending; no new routing or benchmark.

Production Gateway remains status, search_capabilities, describe_capability and invoke_capability. Retain direct-first routing, branch-specific schema retrieval, authoritative receipts and conservative OUTCOME_UNKNOWN recovery. Do not promote hybrid_4_experimental from static replay. control_delta and continuation contain intentional versioned recovery overlap; do not delete it for payload savings. Host search/compaction/model settings remain host-owned.

## Deferred capability-specific residue

- Legacy Active Workspace READMEs contain ambiguous or missing lifecycle fields; Control correctly requests orientation rather than inferring approval. Reconcile only the explicitly selected asset against its current native state; never bulk-rewrite historical models or fabricate approval/checkpoint hashes.
- UV apply receipt authority now governs both Graph readiness and UV/Texture recheck scope; contradictory receipts cannot narrow seam verification. Native Atlas audit reviews orphaned/blank Texture UUIDs; unregistered painted-atlas migration checks both moved-face Texture ownership and resolved native Texture object identity without rejecting valid material overrides. `manage_uv_layout` and painted-atlas migration remain unregistered pending generator and native proof.
- LIVE_BLOCKBENCH is not yet established in this reconciliation. LD-Q01 silhouette, LD-Q02 atlas seams, LD-Q03 rotated pivots, LD-Q04 animation restoration, particle playback, saved-model/reference quality and Golden F retain existing proof boundaries. Use the native runbook only with a matching installed build, functioning Gateway and authorized disposable fixture.
- Windows installer/OS interactions, narrow viewport and real AI token/latency comparisons are separate from source tests. Historical security/dependency results are not current audits. A particular native residue needs its own bounded task; availability of the PC alone is not proof or activation.

## System boundaries and STOP

The persistent Gateway owns client stability and Runtime recovery; Control owns context/readiness; Runtime and Plugin own Blockbench-native state. Geometry and Texturing share AUTHORING; Animation handoff is explicit. Never replay an uncertain mutation.

Only the canonical generators may update these artifacts: API docs, hybrid schemas and Runtime prompts. Keep this document below 6,000 UTF-8 bytes. Stop after source reconciliation, relevant proof and coherent continuity; no release, new public capability or unsolicited asset work.
